        <h3>Rules:<br><br></h3>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Players take turn marking a X or an O on each empty squares</li>
            <li> The game starts with X playing wherever they want in any of the 81 empty spots</li>
            <li> Next the opponent plays, however they are forced to play in the small board indicated by the relative location of the previous move i.e. on black marked boards</li>
            <li>If a move is played so that it is to win a small board by the rules of normal tic-tac-toe, then the entire small board is marked as won by the player in the larger board</li>
            <li>Once a small board is won by a player or it is filled completely, no more moves may be played in that board</li>
            <li>If a player is sent to such a board, then that player may play in any other board</li>
            <li><p>Game play ends when either a player wins the larger board or wins more small boards than the other or there are no legal moves remaining, in which case the game is a draw</p></li>
          </ul>
